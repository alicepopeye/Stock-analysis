# Stock Analysis with VBA

## Overview of Project
We try to find out how the 12 stock do in 2017 and 2018. We compare the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

## Analysis and Challenges
I was so focus on the orignal script that I have a hard time to see how the refactored script try to do. After I understand the logic, then it makes sense.

### Analysis of Stock Performance bewteen 2017 and 2018
The stock has more positive return in 2017 than 2018. All except one stock (TERP) in 2017 have positive return.

### Analysis of Execution time bewteen the original script and the refactored script
They are both fast. The refactored script is faster. When the data expand, that extra speed can make a different.

### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
The advantage of the refactoring code is it made me aware of the same problem and can have various solutions. It challenges me to be more creative and think outside the box. I learned that the extra For loops I used in the original script cause longer time to execute.

The disadvantge of refactoring code is do we have the time to do two different codes. Before I refactor a code, what is the trend? For example, if I wrote an code in certain way, is that acceptable by the general public or by another collegue who need to pick up my work?
